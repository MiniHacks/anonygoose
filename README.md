This is a template project for NextJS, ChakraUI, and socket.io, mainly used for my hackathon (or other quick and dirty) projects. 

You can create a new project from this template by hitting the "Use Template" button on Github.

Install packages with 
```shell
yarn
```
and run the dev server with 
```shell
yarn dev 
```
in the project root. Your app will be live at http://localhost:3000.
